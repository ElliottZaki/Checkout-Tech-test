# Project Title: 
Checkout-exercise

## Motivation:
Practice for a code test. The challenege is to create a mock checkout system. The client is an online marketplace with several products for sale. I will want to be able to represent this using IRB. 

## Summary: 
Checkout-exercise project has been completed. All tests are running successfully. With more time, I would aim at refractoring my programme and implementing easier to read / cleaner code. The tests files in particular could be made more succinct using subject or doubles to remove repetition. <br />
Please follow the instructions on how to run the project below.<br />
Please also note that the project should be run using IRB or a similar tool. Feel free to use the feature tests as an example of how to interact with the project.
